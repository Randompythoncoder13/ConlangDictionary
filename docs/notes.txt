Just thought processes put into words.  And now its a log ig.

I'm thinking about adding another page called File or maybe Project and having some settings there.  Like being able to
rename the project, change to a different project, import/export, etc.  Pretty much where I will put all the I/O for the
new and future technical or non-conlang features.

The main dictionary page is getting crowded and I can't really shove more stuff onto it.  But I want to add things like
pronunciation, different conjugations, etc.  I could display them in the description area as their own section there,
but there's no room to add more inputs.  Maybe change the format?  Have the dictionary be across the screen with sorting
and description at the bottom with a button to add a word making a pop-up dialog window appear.

The word generator is going to be a pain to do.  String parsing is the worst.  Luckily since this is just going to be a
photocopy of Kozuka, so I just have to implement the logic as outlined on the site.  I'll probably find some string
parser/processor library.

Word generator should be done.  Debugging it was a nightmare.  Talk about integration hell.  Theres possibly more issue
so I'll more thoroughly test it latter.

Thought collection for file page:
So I'm going to have the open/make new project option, rename project, delete project, export project, and import
project options.

Changed my mind.  Doing it as a menu bar instead.
